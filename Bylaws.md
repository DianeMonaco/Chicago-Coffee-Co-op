Meetings
========

1. All management decisions for [CO-OP NAME] are to be made by the
    Collective in accordance with the decision making structure
    outlined in this document.
1.  The Collective will meet in a timely and regular fashion.
3.  Members must remember that they have a responsibility to attend meetings of the Collective on a regular basis.
2.  Full Collective meetings take place on [DATE TBD].
3.  The Collective will meet quarterly to discuss budgeting and the
    overall financial situation of the business.
4.  Any decision to be made that affects the bylaws, membership,
    mission, formation and dissolution of committees, location or time
    of regular meetings, or any other major decision must be made during
    a meeting in which at least two-thirds of the membership is present.
    Such decisions will be announced a week in advance. Emergency
    meetings can be called with two thirds of the Collective present.
5.  All other decisions must be made at a meeting where at least one
    half of the collective membership is in attendance.
6.  In the event that the meeting does not yield a consensus on an
    issue, a vote may be made where at least three-fourths of the
    collective members present must agree.
7.  Quorum Exemptions
    1.  Quorum is calculated from the number of collective members that
        have actively participated in at least one general meeting in
        the four weeks preceding the decision or are in attendance at
        the meeting for which quorum is being calculated.
    2.  Individual members can exempt themselves from quorum without
        going on a leave of absence by communicating this to the
        collective. (That is to say, if an active member knows that a
        decision will need to be made at a meeting and fears that
        her/his absence might undermine quorum, that member can inform
        the collective that her/his absence should not be counted
        against quorum.)
    3.  Collective members must remember that they have a responsibility
        to attend meetings of the Collective on a regular basis.

8.  Absence from meetings and decision-making
    1.  There will be no proxy voting.
    2.  If a member, who has attended at least 2 of the previous 4
        general meetings, is not able to attend a meeting where major
        decisions are being made, the member is encouraged to either
        exempt themselves from quorum or strongly request that the
        collective postpone the decision until the member can
        participate.

Collective Membership
=====================

1.  Any person is eligible to become a member of this Collective,
    provided the following conditions are met:
2.  Collective Membership is voluntary, and is based on approval by the
    existing Collective. Prospective members must agree to work within
    the existing by-laws of the Collective.
3.  All [CO-OP NAME] Collective documents, meetings, and meeting notes,
    and other operating agreements are open to scrutiny by any
    Collective member.
5.  The prospective member must fulfill the following requirements
    before the Collective may decide on admission:
    1.  The prospective member must join The Industrial Workers of the
        World, or whatever union currently represents the workers.
    2.  The prospective member must receive training in the store’s
        operation during this period.
    3.  The prospective member shall agree to follow the terms of this
        document, and the [CO-OP NAME] Workers Handbook.

6.  Collective members shall:
    1.  Actively contribute to production, administration or operations
        of the Collective.
    2.  Attend, or make a good faith effort to attend, monthly full
        collective meetings.
    3.  Be committed to collective process, including, but not limited
        to consensus-based decision-making and the maintaining of an
        egalitarian work place.
    4.  Operate the coffeehouse and bookstore in a manner that serves to
        support the maintenance of existing Collective projects.
    5.  Maintain a community space that provides educational material
        and events in accordance with the goals of the Collective.
    6.  Work a minimum number of hours of 20 hours per month in one of
        the Collective’s projects.

7.  Every active worker-owner at [CO-OP NAME] is an equal member of the
    LLC, with an equal voice in the business. Departments determine who
    counts as active, but the Collective/LLC as a whole can override
    these determinations. Good faith attendance at monthly
    full-collective meetings will be a prerequisite of active
    membership.
8.  A member may take a leave of absence from the collective during
    which time the above responsibilities and privileges shall not
    remain in force. Upon reinstatement by the Collective, the member’s
    responsibilities and privileges resume.
9.  Collective members which meet the above requirements are termed
    active members. Collective members who do not meet the above
    requirements(to be reviewed on a quarterly basis) are to be
    considered inactive members. An inactive member loses the ability to
    block decisions, to count against quorum, and to participate in
    voting, but still retains access to the store, is welcome at closed
    meetings of the collective, and counts as a “full collective member”
    for the purposes of scheduling. Inactive members may be reinstated
    as active by the decision of the Collective.
10. Any member may be expelled by the membership for deliberate or
    repeated conduct deemed by the membership to be detrimental to the
    Collective. The member to be expelled must be present at the meeting
    where the expulsion is decided, and shall have an opportunity to
    dispute the charges. While the collective member’s membership is in
    question, the Collective may suspend the rights of the member in
    question to work, volunteer, vote, and act as or claim to be a
    member of the Collective until said member attends a meeting. An
    expelled member may appeal expulsion. Such appeal shall be voted on
    by the membership, following an opportunity for the expelled member
    to be heard, orally or in writing, at the meeting.
11. The Collective maintains the right to hold individual collective
    members, prospective collective members, or other non-member employees personally liable for
    financial losses or damage to assets deemed by the Collective to
    have resulted from malicious behavior on the
    part of said individuals. Such a decision falls under the procedure
    for “major decisions” in section 2.2.


Company structure
=====

Put in a section about structuring as an S corp, structure as LLC

(Founders who work before wage section is implemented automatically
become owners in the LLC)


Wages
=====

1.  The [CO-OP NAME] minimum wage is $15/hr.
2.  Base wages will be paid every two weeks in a timely fashion.
    Surplus wages will be paid on a yearly basis, but only after a
    determination by the LLC that the business was and will continue to
    be sufficiently profitable to make this distribution of wages to
    members a wise decision.
3.  The hourly wage rate will, at the discretion of the LLC, and on an
    annual basis, be adjusted upwards , when the LL elects to:
    1.  raise the base wage of every worker-owner
    2.  establish a raise for current and future worker-owners based
        on the total number of hours they have worked to date

4.  However, at no point is the LLC allowed to raise wages such that
    the difference between the highest paid and lowest paid member
    exceeds a 3:2 ratio.
5.  Additionally, the LLC may elect to give one-time bonuses to all
    members, either in equal amounts or based on the amount of hours
    worked in a given period. Such bonuses should reflect anticipated
    surpluses, but do not need to wait for the final determination of
    profit/loss at the end of the fiscal year. Such bonuses should be
    treated, for tax purposes, as extra wages.

    // Potentially add a section for times of financial distress
    // And how wages would be structured

    // In times of financial distress, any funds would be paid in equal share
    // of what is available with the intention of paying full wages
    // (including backpay) as soon as funds are available

Hiring
======

1.  Hiring takes place either:
    1.  When a department cannot fill allocated hours from within the
        current collective
    2.  When a department receives an allocation of additional paid
        hours from the full collective at a quarterly budgeting meeting,
        or in exceptional circumstances, at a monthly meeting.

2.  The hiring process will be as follows:
    1.  The department forms a hiring committee
    2.  The department can solicit applicants in whatever way makes
        sense to them. This could be very informal, or involve a
        publicly advertised position
    3.  After narrowing down the candidates to people who they feel
        should get an interview:
        1.  The names of those candidates are circulated to the full
            collective; there is a three day window before any interview
            can take place in case someone has a blocking concern
        2.  A person from outside the hiring department, selected by
            the advisory council, joins the hiring committee and takes
            part in the interviews and selection of person to be
            hired.

    4.  Once a candidate has been selected:
        1.  The candidate can start paid work immediately in a
            probationary period, as an employee of [CO-OP NAME].
        2.  After at least 1 month + 20 hrs of work, after a
            departmental review, the new hire is interviewed by the full
            collective at a monthly collective meeting.
        3.  If the full collective approves the hire, they become a
            prospective collective member.  A prospective collective member
            remains an employee of [CO-OP NAME], but may enjoy additional
            privileges and responsibilities as outlined elsewhere in
            these by-laws.

    5.  After three months:
        1.  There is another departmental review.

    6.  After six months as a prospective collective member:
        1.  After a final departmental review, the full collective
            reviews the new hire, and if there are no blocking concerns,
            the prospective member is added to the LLC as a member and becomes a collective member.
	2.  If either the department or the full collective determines
   	    the new hire is not ready for collective membership at six
   	    months, the process may be extended for up to an
   	    additional six months, with a final review at both levels
   	    necessary before become a member of the LLC and
   	    collective.

    8.  All reviews are recorded and kept on file, and are geared to
        provide a standardized formula for evaluation.
    9.  The existence of scheduled reviews by a department or the full
        collective do not preclude termination for gross incompetence or
        malicious behavior.

Firing
======

1.  Department- vs. Collective-level Firing
    1.  Firing may be initiated at the department level or at the
        collective level. Firing is initiated at the department level in
        instances of incompetence, unprofessionalism, or general “bad
        fit”.
    2.  Firing at the collective level is reserved for behavior
        sufficiently transgressive or destructive that it substantially
        impacts members of departments other than the department of the
        worker in the firing process.

2.  Department level firing:
    1.  Departments are mandated to develop written internal standards
        for competence and professionalism specific to the work of the
        department and make these standards available to collective
        members and new hires. It is the role of the department to
        assess if a department member is adhering to these standards.
    2.  Departments will develop internal procedures for initiating
        firing and providing process to department members. No worker
        will be fired by a department without first being given the
        opportunity to discuss specific problems in their performance
        with the department. The intent of these discussions is to help
        the worker in question to improve their performance.
    3.  As an intermediate step or an alternative to firing,
        departments may establish special benchmarks for individual
        workers meant to re-establish confidence in the good faith
        and/or competence of the department member . Departments are
        encouraged to develop a routine performance review process for
        department members.
    4.  Notes from any firing procedures, as well performance reviews,
        and the details of any special benchmarks set for workers must
        be stored in a file in the [CO-OP NAME] office and be available to
        any members of the collective. All of these documents must be
        reviewed and signed by the department members participating in
        the process including the worker under review, and the member
        under review is invited to attach their own explanatory notes .
        In the instance of firing due to consistent lateness or absence
        for shifts, individual instances of lateness or absence must be
        documented.
    5.  Workers will not work in
        the store while intoxicated and repeated breach of this policy
        may result in firing.
    6.  No department may initiate a firing without a vote, excepting instances
        of documented grievous misconduct.

3.  Collective-level firing:
    1.  A worker who is alleged by another worker to have performed
        one of the following acts is banned from the store immediately
        and until an emergency closed collective meeting can be held:
        sexual or other physical assault on a collective member or other
        space-user, theft or malicious destruction of collective
        property or property on the premises, clandestine collaboration with law enforcement or
        intelligence services, and illegally using or distributing drugs
        in or around the store. Failure to observe this ban will result
        in firing.
    2.  The purpose of the emergency meeting is to determine the
        factual circumstances of the event and the appropriate
        collective response up to and including firing and banning.
    3.  All decisions at these emergency meetings are treated as major
        decisions.
    4.  Other forms of obnoxious, harassing, or abusive behavior will
        be addressed through the [CO-OP NAME] grievance procedure, with
        firing as a possible outcome.

4.  Logistics of Firing:
    1.  A collective member who no longer has membership in any
        department due to firing will be treated for all other purposes
        like a collective member who has voluntarily left the
        collective.
    2.  When a worker is fired at the collective level, all issues
        related to keys, passwords, and the disbursement of shares will
        be determined by the collective on a case-by-case basis.

Employees who are not collective members
========================================

1.  As necessary, departments may decide to hire workers who do not
    intend to become members of the collective, pursuant to the approval
    of the collective as stipulated in “Hiring”
2.  Because we value a democratic workplace, such workers are
    understood to either be filling a temporary need that is limited in
    duration, or contributing in a strictly delimited part-time manner
    to the operations of the business. Non collective members should
    either:
    1.  Work one year or less in the project *or*
    2.  Work eight hours or less per week, averaged on a quarterly
        basis, in the project

3.  Workers exceeding the limitations above should be considered for
    collective membership, and should not remain employed if they exceed
    the above limits but the collective declines to extend an offer of
    membership.
4.  Because we value an egalitarian workplace, such workers shall not
    be paid an hourly wage less than the lowest paid member of the
    collective.


Departments (for when we're big enough to require it
===========

1.  The day-to-day work of the collective shall be carried out by the
    following departments:
    1.  Food Department
    1.  Books department (Books, Periodicals, Zines, Ephemera,
        Shwag, Tabling co-ordination, Course texts, online ordering)
    1.  Programming and publicity department
    1.  Infrastructure department (Tech, facility, financial
        recordkeeping, accounting, and tax/regulatory compliance)

2.  Departments will meet regularly, and will be responsible for
    assigning tasks to their members.

Grievance Procedure
===================

1.  Collective members and prospective collective members can present
    grievances against individuals or the Collective as a whole to the
    Collective during regular meetings. Such grievances will be
    considered priority agenda items.
2.  If the intent of presenting a grievance is to seek mediation or
    intervention from the Collective in redress of the grievance, it
    should be treated as a major decision as outlined in section 2.2.
3.  It is within the rights of the person presenting a grievance to
    request that the meeting (or portion of a meeting) in which the
    grievance will be aired be closed to all but full collective
    members. If the grievance involves individual collective members or
    prospective members, the individuals airing the grievance may
    request that the meeting (or relevant portion of the meeting) be
    closed to the individuals against whom the grievance was made. These
    individuals also have the right to request that they have an
    opportunity to meet with the Collective without the presence of the
    individuals who originally brought forth the grievance. No decisions
    may be made by the collective regarding the grievance without both
    parties involved being given the opportunity to return to the
    meeting.
4.  If a meeting has been closed in accordance with 6.3, the collective
    can decide to reopen the meeting in order to pursue
    resolution/redress or to continue discussing the grievance.
5.  The collective may seek outside mediation if it is unable to
    successfully resolve a grievance.


(Is this part necessary for right now?)
Advisory Council (proposed language, general direction agreed on in 2013)
=========================================================================

1.  The advisory council is made up of a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2
    members from each department, who agree to serve a minimum term of
    one year, and who must have been a collective member for at least a
    year before becoming part of the council.
2.  Individual departments make selection of delegates to the advisory
    council according to whatever procedure and norms they feel are most
    appropriate, with the assumption that people who want to serve on
    the council should have that opportunity within a reasonable amount
    of time.
3.  The advisory council is required to meet monthly, and attendance is
    mandatory for members.
4.  The advisory council is tasked with keeping an eye on the overall
    situation of the project, especially but not exclusively relating to
    financial matters.
5.  The advisory council helps prepare budgeting proposals for quarterly
    meetings.
6.  The advisory council is not a decision making body.
7.  Membership on the advisory council may (but is not required to) be a
    compensated position given the expectations that work outside of
    meetings may be required in order to make informed decisions.
8.  The advisory council is required to take minutes of all meetings and
    make those available to the collective.

Relationship of the [CO-OP NAME] Collective to [CO-OP NAME] LLC
===========================================================

4.  Membership in the LLC is subject in all cases to the decisions of
    the Collective taken in accordance with the stipulations of this
    document, with the specific consequences that:
    1.  Membership in the LLC is not transferable.
    2.  New members of the LLC will in all cases be Collective members,
        and their admission to the LLC will be subject to the approval
        of the Collective.
    3.  Membership in the LLC does not grant said members any right to
        dispose of or lay claim to the assets of the LLC except as
        stipulated by the decisions of the Collective.
    4.  Members of the LLC, by signing these By-Laws, waive any rights
        they may have as LLC-members which conflict with the
        stipulations on said rights as outlined here, and waive the
        right to exercise any rights as LLC members which are not
        specifically limited here without the approval of the
        Collective.
